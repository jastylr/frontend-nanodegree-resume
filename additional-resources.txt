Moved Google Maps code from helper.js to resumeBuilder.js and wrapped entire code in Javascript Immediately Invoked Function Expression so not to pollute the global scope with all the project variables. The Google Maps code directly accesses some of the objects in resumeBuilder.js hence the reason for moving them together. I'm sure this could have been avoid by using a modular design but I have not learned that yet with Javascript.
