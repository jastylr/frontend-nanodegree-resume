## Resume for Jason Taylor - Front-end Web Designer/Developer

This resume started out as a project for the Udacity Front-end Web Development Nanodegree program. The content of the resume is populated using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and various display functions to handle each section of the page.

I eventually added Boostrap to the site to provide a responsive, grid layout and I also used the JQuery Featherlight plugin to provide lightbox capabilities to the individual Project sections.
